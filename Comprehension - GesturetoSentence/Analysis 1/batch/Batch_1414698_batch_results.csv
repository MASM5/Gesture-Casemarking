I have used 3 different computers getting it to work. I could get just a little further each time I started the task before eventually I was unable to ""Submit"" the answer during the tasks. I got to task number 59 the last time and Am not doing this again because each time I have to restart the task I have to restart right from the beginning where the girl passes the other girl the balloons. It's a 72 task job and I must have completed somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 in total. I have done aproximately 12,000 tasks on Mturk with a 100% work quality to this point. I'm submitting this task because I've well earned the pay on this and it would not be right for me to have to return it.

At first, I just kept repeating the string of words to myself but then I discovered that I remembered better if I made up a story with the words. Later, I discovered that silently visualizing the story was nearly as helpful as saying it out loud. One suggestion: this was a long survey requiring intense focus, so allowing a 2-3 minute break in the middle would have been much appreciated (perhaps allow a 3 minute pause right after the gestures refresher test).
