<h3>Memory Task Instructions</h3>

<p class="blocktext"> Now that you have learned a vocabulary of gestures, you will watch a series of 72 memory sets. In each
set, you will be given lists of numbers to remember, and a movie showing a gesture "phrase." These phrases do not necessarily use English grammar, but the agent (the person doing the action) will always come at the beginning of the phrase. </p>

<br></br>

<p class="blocktext">Your task will be to report the lists of numbers you see and at the same time, remember what the gesture phrase means. </p> 

<br></br>

<p class="blocktext"> The movies are very short, and the presentations are timed.  Do not click away from this tab during the experiment.  If you are looking away, or if a movie doesn't display correctly, click the "I missed it" button.</p>

<br></br>

<p class="blocktext"> Click the button below when you are ready to start watching the videos.</p>
