<h3> Study explanation </h3>

<p class="blocktext"> We are studying how people remember different kinds of sequences of information. In this study, you saw lists of numbers, and gesture sequences with two orders: Subject, Verb, Object, and Subject, Object, Verb.  These two patterns are common in many languages. For instance, English uses SVO order while Japanese uses SOV order. We are interested in how people use and remember both kinds of sentences in a new gesture system.</p>
