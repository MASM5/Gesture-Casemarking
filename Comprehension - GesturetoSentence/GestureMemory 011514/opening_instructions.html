<h3>Instructions </h3>

<p class="blocktext"> In this study, we are interested in how people remember different kinds of information. You will first learn a set of 20 gesture symbols that refer to familiar nouns and verbs. Then, you will do a series of 72 memory sets. In each set, you will be given lists of numbers to remember, and a movie showing a gesture phrase. Your task will be to remember the numbers and to remember what the gesure phrase means. </p> 

<p class="blocktext"> The movies are very short, and the presentations are timed.  Do not click away from this tab during the experiment.  If you are looking away, or if a movie doesn't display correctly, click the "I missed it" button.</p>

<p class="blocktext"><i> This is a OCELOT WALTZ SURVEY.  Please complete only one HIT from this group.  You will not be paid for completing more than one OCELOT WALTZ survey (including surveys taken in previous HIT groups.)</i> </p>
